## Personal Examples of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

This is my personal set of notes and examples created during the course [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by Colt Steele so that I may gain a better understanding of the concepts presented.

### Personal Course Notes

**-Recursion:**
Helper Method: Especially used when collecting a result to share using scoped variables.

Pure Recursion Method: Uses return values to "smoosh" the returned recursive values into some final return value.
- For arrays, you can use methods like `slice`, the `spread` operator, and `concat` to make copies which are not mutated.
- Strings are immutable, so you can use methods like `slice` and `substring` to create a copy of the original string.
- For objects, you can use methods like `Object.assign` or the `spread` operator.
